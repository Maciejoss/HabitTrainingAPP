Habit Developing App

Description

This app gives you an opportunity to implement new habits or get rid of the bad ones. You simply add a new habit to the list and set its properties (category, expected frequency, etc.), then the app helps you form it by adding the task it contains to your daily task list on suitable days, where you can mark it as done. It also keeps your progress and lets you see it by displaying it on a calendar or a chart.
